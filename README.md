# Overview

For this project, I wanted to get a basic understanding of how to program using Erlang. The software I aimed to create is a calculator to preform various math problems someone may encounter in life.

The purpose for writing this software was to build my skills by learning the syntax of Erlang. This project helped me learn how to write functions, fix errors, and manage the state of Erlang. This project also helped me learn more about recursion and pattern matching in Erlang. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this software included Erlang, VS Code, and the Rebar3 Shell. Erlang was the language I used for programming this project. VS Code was the app I used to type the code. Rebar3 Shell was what I used to run the code. 

Erlang is a programming language used mostly in telecommunications, wireless, and internet infrastructures. It does well with recursion. It was originally developed by Ericsson for telecommunications systems. Erlang is known for concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing.
